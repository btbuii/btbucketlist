      "commentary": "PDT is a unique speakeasy experience that's hidden behind a hot dog shop. You enter through a phone booth in the hot dog shop, adding to the mystery and excitement. The cocktails are expertly crafted and creative, though expensive. The atmosphere is intimate and the service is excellent. Reservations are required and can be hard to get, but the experience is worth the effort. This is a great place for a special night out or to impress visitors."

The permanent collection includes works by Van Gogh, Picasso, Warhol, and many other iconic artists. The museum can be crowded, especially on free Friday nights, so plan accordingly. The admission fee is reasonable for the quality and quantity of art on display."

The pastrami is perfectly seasoned and tender, and the sandwiches are massive. The atmosphere is authentic and bustling, with a mix of tourists and locals. The prices are high but the portions are huge, making it good value for the amount of food. This is a must-visit for anyone wanting to experience classic New York deli culture."

The 25-minute ride provides excellent views of the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, and the Manhattan skyline. The ferry runs frequently and is completely free, making it an incredible value. The outdoor decks offer the best views, though they can be crowded during peak times. This is a must-do for visitors wanting to see the Statue of Liberty without paying for a tour."
